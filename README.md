## TODO
aradia: possible
karkat: possible uncap? check users w screen readers?
vriska: started but lots of exceptions
feferi: to start
gamzee: uncaps but after 8r8king go all caps. If page num > ?

### options
random replacement - set % value for all transforms. Allows quirks to still read but not every instance
cap/uncap - gamzee, kanaya, karkat, terezi, tavros options. All need looking at individually. Not opposed to keeping Kan Camel Case, KARKAT AND TZ ALL CAPS
